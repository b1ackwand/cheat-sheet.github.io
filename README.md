This project is my Cheat Sheet for HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”a simple and stylish reference to help me (and maybe others) navigate essential web elements.    I created this as a personal learning project to sharpen my skills while making something useful. Feel free to check it out, contribute, or just say hi!
